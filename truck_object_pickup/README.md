#Simple pickup/put down game

Change game settigns by changing the vars


int speed = 10;
boolean AutoPickup = true;
int wWidth = 800;
int wHeight = int(wWidth/1.5);
color background = color(04, 102, 0);
color truckColor = color(64, 20, 40);
color objectColor = color(224, 220, 80);



when changing AutoPickup to false, the game requires you to press enter when you are on an object. otherwise the truck will pickup his own objects
